* Only short near jumps are implemented (jumps within signed 32-bits can be the max jump value).
* Only integers are implemented.
* Immediate values cannot be moved to memory, they have to be moved to a register and then moved to memory.
* Cannot add anything to memory directly. The result should be stored in a register and if required then moved to memory.

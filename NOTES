* Only short near jumps are implemented (jumps within signed 32-bits can be the max jump value).
* Only integers are implemented.
* Immediate values cannot be moved to memory, they have to be moved to a register and then moved to memory.
* Cannot add anything to memory directly. The result should be stored in a register and if required then moved to memory.

* Loop detection algorithm in datastructures.py assumes that the CFG is reducible.

* For InputNum please enter only 7 digits or less. The current implementation starts storing the bytes at %rsp-8
  and upwards. So the 8th byte must be the newline character, if that is not the case, the return address
  for the InputNum function is rewritten and we are lost!
